# face-recognition
Code to build a simple face recognition system using the face_recognition library in Python.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. This project was developed using Python version 3.11.9. In my case I used VSCode and was on macOS.

You also need to install the following libraries:

- cmake (version 3.25.2)
- dlib (version 19.24.2)
- face_recognition
- numpy (version 1.23.5)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install cmake==3.25.2
pip install dlib==19.24.2
pip3 install face_recognition
pip install numpy==1.23.5
